we have browser, need to create a server use express for this, we need to listen like /: home route, /login: login setup, will handle get request

To create empty node application
npm init

We can run the js file using node index.js but when we run on server we should specify the commands in package.json file
like "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  
to run this script --> use npm run start  


After changing anything in index.js file, doesnt reflect on server, so for this we have to restart server everytime after modfiying index.js


To add to github
git init
git add *
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Yutika-Nemade/Backend.git
git push -u origin main
